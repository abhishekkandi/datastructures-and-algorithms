Hashing Problems

1) Given an array of n integers, k integer. Count the no of pairs whose sum is divisible by k
Hint: First take % k of all elements in array, later solve it with two sum approach (using hashing)
- Desired time complexity -> O(n)

Problem Solving - 5 (Discussed in class)

1) Given 2 strings A & B. Find the count of all permutations of A present in B as substring.
2) Given an Array of N integers. Minimize the difference between maximum & minimum.
3) Given a integer N. Count the number of set bits from 1 to N.
(Already solved in scaler assignment), 
Try approach taught in class too -> Dynamic programming (Recursion with memorization) & pattern

Problem Solving - 6 (Discussed in class)

1) Revisit first question
2) Given N bulbs with switches of state 0 or 1, If ith switch is toggled,
it will toggle state of remaining j bulbs (j >= i)
3) Given an Array A { 0, 1 } of size n & Q queries Q(L,R)
First query should return XOR of elements from L,R
Second query should return number of zeroes from L,R 
4) Given a floor of dimensions of N * M
Given square tiles of size a * a which need to cover floor with tiles
& you're allowed more area than the floor. 
But not allowed to break the tiles.
Need to return min number of tiles required to cover all the floors.
Answer -> ceil(MN/AA)
5) Given an array of size N. Value of subarray is defined as Bitwise OR of all elements in the subarray. 
Find the subarray of all elements. (Rewatch its explaination)
